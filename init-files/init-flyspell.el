;; According to the aspell documentation, "ultra" is the fastest mode,
;; which is still twice as slow as ispell. If your machine is fast
;; enough, a better option might be to try "fast" mode, which is twice
;; as slow as "ultra", but more accurate. The "normal" mode, which is
;; the aspell default, is even more accurate, but is reportedly 10
;; times slower than "fast" mode, and on my machine it makes editing
;; and motion around the buffer noticeably sluggish when in
;; flyspell-mode. YMMV, depending on how fast your machine is, and how
;; big your word-lists are.
